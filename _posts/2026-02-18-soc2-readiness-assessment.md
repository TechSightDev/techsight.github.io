**SOC 2 readiness in 2–3 weeks. Technical gap analysis, risk register, and an implementation roadmap—not another deck.**

We assess your *technical* gaps (infra, RBAC, logging, secrets) and give you a prioritized plan with timeline and cost. Implementation guidance, not just documentation.

## Technical-First SOC 2 Assessment

If you are a B2B SaaS company pursuing enterprise deals or planning a fundraise, compliance is critical. We offer a technical-first approach:

1.  **Infrastructure Deep Dive**: We look under the hood at your infrastructure, architecture, and controls—not just your policies.
2.  **Implementation Roadmap**: You get a clear plan with phases, dependencies, ballpark costs, and a realistic timeline (e.g., 6–9 months to Type II).
3.  **Low Commitment, High Signal**: Get a fast, technical read on your gaps and costs in just 2–3 weeks.
4.  **Proven Methodology**: Our process is built from successful SOC 2 Type II experiences and reused across clients.

## Don't Navigate Compliance Alone

Whether you've lost a deal due to security questionnaires or want to prepare for a Series A/B, our assessment identifies root causes and the correct order of operations.

Get a roadmap to readiness today.
