**Technical due diligence for AI. Know if you’re ready to build—and where to start.**

We assess your data, infrastructure, use cases, and cost structure. You get a prioritized roadmap and a clear “build vs. buy” view—before you pour budget into the wrong bet.

## Why Technical AI Readiness?

Many organizations have "AI on the roadmap" but haven't committed to a first use case, or have stalled after a Proof of Concept (POC). We provide a technical-first assessment that looks at:

1.  **Data Pipelines & Quality**: Is your infrastructure fit for LLMs? We move beyond strategy fluff to technical reality.
2.  **Use-Case Prioritization**: We help you pick the first bet based on Impact × Feasibility × Data Readiness.
3.  **Cost Modeling**: We model the real costs—POC vs 10x vs 100x scale. We look at tokens, embeddings, pipeline, and ops to provide a reality check before you scale.
4.  **Build vs. Buy**: We offer pragmatic advice on when to use managed services versus self-hosted models, and what to build versus integrate.

## Who Is This For?

This assessment is ideal for CTOs, VPs of Engineering, or Heads of Product at B2B SaaS or data-rich companies who want a clear “are we ready?” answer and a “what first?” roadmap in just 2 weeks.

Stop guessing. Get a technical read on your data and infrastructure today.
