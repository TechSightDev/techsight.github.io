**Ship a production-ready RAG chatbot in 2 weeks—on your data, in your cloud.**

No strategy decks. A working system you can demo, iterate on, and scale. We build once; you own it.

## The RAG Chatbot Quickstart

If you have internal knowledge you want searchable (docs, wiki, KB) or customer-facing support needs, but have delayed building an AI chatbot due to bandwidth or uncertainty, our Quickstart is the answer.

### Key Benefits:

1.  **Fixed Scope, Fixed Timeline**: We deliver in exactly 2 weeks. No scope creep.
2.  **Production-Ready**: This isn't a throwaway POC. We include observability, cost controls, and re-ingestion runbooks.
3.  **Your Infrastructure**: We deploy to your AWS (or approved cloud). You own the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and the codebase.
4.  **Extendable**: We provide a clear handoff so your team can add sources, tweak prompts, and scale the system themselves.

## Why Choose Us?

We understand that you need to show something real, not another slide deck. Our solution allows you to ship a product that is yours and actually runs in production.

Get a working chatbot on your docs in 2 weeks.
