**Technical due diligence for AI. Know if you’re ready to build—and where to start.**

We assess your data, infrastructure, use cases, and cost structure. You get a prioritized roadmap and a clear “build vs. buy” view—before you pour budget into the wrong bet.

## Why Technical AI Readiness?

Many organizations have "AI on the roadmap" but haven't committed to a first use case, or have stalled after a Proof of Concept (POC). We provide a targeted, technical-first assessment that looks at:

1.  **Data Pipelines & Quality**: Is your infrastructure fit for LLMs? We move beyond strategy fluff to technical reality.
2.  **Use-Case Prioritization**: We help you pick the first bet based on Impact × Feasibility × Data Readiness.
3.  **Cost Modeling & Guardrails**: We model the real costs and ROI of POC vs 10x vs 100x scale. We look at tokens, embeddings, pipeline, and ops to provide a reality check before you scale.
4.  **Build vs. Buy**: We offer pragmatic advice on when to use managed services versus self-hosted models, and what to build versus integrate.

## The ROI of Experience: Avoiding the "Rabbit Hole"

The biggest risk in AI isn't failing to build; it's blowing through your budget on a project that never reaches production. Less experienced teams often fall into common traps that we help you navigate:

*   **Unconstrained Cost Spirals**: Without proper token management and architectural guardrails, a successful POC can quickly become a financial liability at scale. We implement cost constraints early, ensuring your unit economics make sense before you commit.
*   **The Research Rabbit Hole**: It's easy to get lost in model tuning or chasing the latest academic benchmark. We focus on "Production-First AI"—getting a reliable, monitorable system into the hands of users rather than perfecting a model in a vacuum.
*   **Infrastructure Debt**: Building AI without a clear data strategy often leads to "spaghetti pipelines" that are impossible to maintain. We ensure your foundation is built for the long term, not just for a demo.

By investing in a 2-week Readiness Assessment, you're not just buying a roadmap; you're buying insurance against the millions of dollars lost to failed AI initiatives and misaligned technical bets. We bring the hard-won experience of seeing what actually works in production, so you don't have to learn those lessons on your own dime.

## Who Is This For?

This assessment is ideal for CEOs, CTOs, or Heads of Product at B2B SaaS or data-rich companies who want a clear “are we ready?” answer and a “what first?” roadmap in just 2 weeks.
