        <p>Every B2B SaaS company has “AI” on the roadmap. Most will spend six figures learning what they should have assessed in two weeks. This checklist is the assessment framework we use at TechSight to evaluate whether an organization is actually ready to build AI features — and where to start when they are.</p>

<h2 id="why-ai-projects-stall-and-what-to-do-about-it">Why AI Projects Stall (and What to Do About It)</h2>

<p>The pattern is predictable. A team gets excited about a use case — maybe an AI-powered search feature or an intelligent recommendation engine. They spin up a proof of concept. The demo looks great. Then reality hits: the data isn’t clean enough, the infrastructure can’t support real-time inference at scale, and nobody modeled what it would cost to serve 10,000 users instead of 10.</p>

<p>The POC joins what we call the “POC graveyard” — a collection of impressive demos that never reached production.</p>

<p>The fix isn’t more ambition. It’s more preparation. The companies that ship AI features successfully do the unglamorous work first: auditing data, stress-testing infrastructure, modeling costs, and aligning their teams. That’s what this checklist covers.</p>

<h2 id="1-data-readiness-the-foundation-that-makes-or-breaks-ai">1. Data Readiness: The Foundation That Makes or Breaks AI</h2>

<p>Data readiness isn’t about having “big data.” It’s about having the <em>right</em> data, in a <em>usable</em> state, accessible through <em>reliable</em> pipelines.</p>

<p><strong>Pipeline reliability.</strong> Can you get fresh data from your source systems to your AI application without manual intervention? If your ETL jobs fail silently or require a developer to restart them, you’re not ready for production AI. AI systems are only as reliable as the data feeding them.</p>

<p><strong>Data quality.</strong> Duplicates, missing fields, inconsistent formats — these problems don’t just degrade model performance, they make results unpredictable. Before you fine-tune a model or build a RAG pipeline, establish quality baselines for the data you plan to use. Quantify completeness, consistency, and freshness.</p>

<p><strong>Data volume and relevance.</strong> You don’t need millions of records. You need enough relevant, representative data for your specific use case. A customer support chatbot needs a comprehensive knowledge base. A recommendation engine needs behavioral data with sufficient coverage. Audit what you have against what your use case demands.</p>

<p><strong>What to check:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Are your data pipelines automated, monitored, and recoverable?</li>
  <li>Can you quantify data quality (completeness, consistency, freshness) for AI-relevant datasets?</li>
  <li>Do you have sufficient relevant data for your target use case, in an accessible format?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-infrastructure--architecture-can-your-stack-support-ai-workloads">2. Infrastructure &amp; Architecture: Can Your Stack Support AI Workloads?</h2>

<p>AI features place specific demands on your infrastructure that traditional SaaS features don’t. LLM calls introduce latency. Embedding generation requires compute. Vector databases need dedicated storage. If your architecture can’t accommodate these, your AI feature will either be slow, expensive, or fragile.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud maturity.</strong> AI workloads benefit enormously from cloud-native patterns — auto-scaling, containerized deployments, infrastructure as code. If you’re still doing manual deployments or running on-prem, the infrastructure buildout will add months to your timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Architectural flexibility.</strong> Can your application integrate external API calls (to an LLM provider, for example) without a major refactor? Service-oriented or microservice architectures make this straightforward. Tightly coupled monoliths make it painful.</p>

<p><strong>Observability.</strong> AI systems fail in subtle ways — not with crashes, but with degraded quality. You need monitoring that goes beyond uptime checks. Think: response latency percentiles, token usage tracking, and output quality metrics. If you can’t measure it, you can’t maintain it.</p>

<p><strong>What to check:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have cloud-native deployment with CI/CD and some form of IaC?</li>
  <li>Can your architecture support async processing and external API integrations?</li>
  <li>Is your observability stack mature enough to monitor AI-specific metrics (latency, cost, quality)?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-use-case-prioritization-pick-the-right-first-bet">3. Use-Case Prioritization: Pick the Right First Bet</h2>

<p>The biggest mistake teams make isn’t choosing the wrong technology — it’s choosing the wrong use case. The right first AI project has three characteristics: clear user value, technical feasibility with your current stack, and data that’s already accessible.</p>

<p><strong>Specificity over ambition.</strong> “Add AI to the product” is not a use case. “Auto-generate summary reports from customer interaction data” is. The more specific you are, the easier it is to scope, build, and measure.</p>

<p><strong>Workflow mapping.</strong> Before you think about models, map the end-to-end user experience. Where does AI add value in the workflow? What happens when the AI is wrong? What’s the fallback? These questions surface requirements that pure technical spikes miss.</p>

<p><strong>Build vs. buy at the component level.</strong> This isn’t an all-or-nothing decision. You might use a managed LLM API for generation, an open-source library for embeddings, and build your own retrieval logic. Evaluate each component independently based on differentiation value, cost, and maintenance burden.</p>

<p><strong>What to check:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your top use case specific enough to scope, build, and measure within 6-8 weeks?</li>
  <li>Have you mapped the full user workflow including edge cases and failure modes?</li>
  <li>Have you evaluated build vs. buy at the component level, not just as a single decision?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-cost--roi-modeling-the-math-nobody-wants-to-do">4. Cost &amp; ROI Modeling: The Math Nobody Wants to Do</h2>

<p>This is where most AI initiatives go off the rails. A POC costs a few hundred dollars in API calls. Production at scale costs orders of magnitude more. If you haven’t modeled the curve between those two points, you’re flying blind.</p>

<p><strong>Unit economics.</strong> What does it cost to serve one AI-powered request? Include token costs, embedding generation, vector database queries, compute, and operational overhead. Multiply by your expected volume. If the number doesn’t work at 10x your current user count, the architecture needs to change before you scale.</p>

<p><strong>ROI quantification.</strong> “It’ll improve retention” isn’t a business case. Quantify the baseline metric, set a realistic target, and calculate the dollar value of the improvement. Compare that to the all-in cost (build + run + maintain). If the payback period is longer than 12 months, your executive team will lose patience.</p>

<p><strong>Cost guardrails.</strong> Production AI systems need architectural constraints: token budgets per request, caching layers, rate limiting, tiered processing (use a cheaper model for simple queries, escalate to a more capable model when needed). Design these into the architecture from day one, not as an afterthought.</p>

<p><strong>What to check:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Have you modeled costs across POC, 10x, and 100x scale with per-unit economics?</li>
  <li>Can you quantify the business value AI would deliver against a measurable baseline?</li>
  <li>Have you designed cost guardrails (token budgets, caching, rate limiting) into the architecture?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-team--process-readiness-the-human-side">5. Team &amp; Process Readiness: The Human Side</h2>

<p>Technology doesn’t ship itself. Your team’s experience, your organization’s alignment, and your development culture all determine whether an AI project succeeds or stalls.</p>

<p><strong>Skills and experience.</strong> You don’t need a team of ML PhDs. But you do need engineers who understand LLM integration patterns, prompt engineering, and the operational characteristics of AI systems. If that experience doesn’t exist internally, plan for it — through hiring, upskilling, or a technical partner.</p>

<p><strong>Executive sponsorship.</strong> AI projects that live exclusively in engineering rarely survive contact with budget reviews. You need an executive sponsor who understands the investment, has allocated budget, and can champion the initiative cross-functionally. Product and go-to-market alignment matters too — building a feature nobody sells is a waste.</p>

<p><strong>Shipping culture.</strong> AI features benefit from rapid iteration. You’ll ship a first version, collect feedback, and improve. Teams that are comfortable with feature flags, A/B testing, and iterative delivery will move faster than teams with quarterly release cycles.</p>

<p><strong>What to check:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Does your team have practical experience with LLM integration and production AI systems?</li>
  <li>Is there executive sponsorship with allocated budget and cross-functional alignment?</li>
  <li>Can your team ship iteratively with feature flags, experimentation, and rapid feedback loops?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="from-assessment-to-action">From Assessment to Action</h2>

<p>If you scored yourself honestly across these five dimensions, you likely have a clear picture of where you’re strong and where the gaps are. That’s the point. The companies that succeed with AI aren’t the ones with the most sophisticated technology — they’re the ones that understand their starting point and build from there.</p>

<p><strong>Want to quantify where you stand?</strong> Take our free <a href="/scorecard.html">AI Readiness Scorecard</a> — a 3-minute self-assessment that scores your organization across all five dimensions and provides personalized recommendations.</p>
