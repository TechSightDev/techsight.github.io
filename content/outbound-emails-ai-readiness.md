# Outbound Email Sequence — AI Readiness Assessment

3-email sequence for outbound prospecting. Target: CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and Heads of Product at B2B SaaS companies showing AI intent signals (job postings for ML/AI roles, roadmap mentions, recent funding).

Plain text format. ~100-150 words each. Personalization slots marked with {{brackets}}.

## Email 1: Signal-Based Opener (Day 0)

**Subject:** {{company_name}}'s AI plans — quick question

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{signal — e.g., "you're hiring for an ML engineer" / "your recent Series B announcement mentioned AI-powered features" / "your product roadmap includes intelligent recommendations"}}.

When we work with B2B SaaS companies at that stage, the biggest risk isn't building the wrong thing. It's building before the foundation is ready — data pipelines, cost modeling, infrastructure.

We run a 2-week AI Readiness Assessment that gives you a scored evaluation and prioritized roadmap before you commit engineering resources. It's designed to save months of false starts.

Would it make sense to spend 20 minutes talking through where {{company_name}} stands?

Here's my calendar if so: {{calendly_link}}

## Email 2: Value-Add Follow-Up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: {{company_name}}'s AI plans — quick question

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to share something quick in case it's useful.

When we assess a company's AI readiness, here are the first three things we check:

1. Can the data for the target use case be accessed through reliable, automated pipelines? (Not "do you have data" — can you move it reliably.)

2. Has anyone modeled costs at 10x the POC volume? The gap between demo cost and production cost is where most projects die.

3. Is there a specific use case defined with measurable success criteria? "Add AI" isn't a use case. "Reduce support resolution time by 30% using automated responses" is.

If you already have good answers to all three, you're ahead of 90% of the companies we talk to. If not, that's exactly what the assessment is designed to solve.

Happy to walk through it: {{calendly_link}}

## Email 3: Breakup / Low-Pressure Close (Day 7)

**Subject:** Re: {{company_name}}'s AI plans — quick question

Hi {{first_name}},

I'll keep this short — I know timing isn't always right.

If a conversation doesn't make sense right now, no worries at all. In the meantime, we built a free AI Readiness Scorecard that lets you self-assess across 5 dimensions in about 3 minutes: https://techsight.dev/scorecard

No email gate, no sales follow-up. Just a quick read on where things stand.

If the timing changes or you want to talk through results, I'm always here: {{calendly_link}}

Best,
