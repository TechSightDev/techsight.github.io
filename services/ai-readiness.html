      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Many organizations have "AI on the roadmap" but haven't committed to a first use case, or have stalled after a Proof of Concept. The biggest risk in AI isn't failing to build—it's blowing through your budget on a project that never reaches production.</p>
        <p>Less experienced teams often fall into common traps that burn time and money:</p>

    <div class="row mt-4">
      <div class="col-md-4 mb-4">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Unconstrained Cost Spirals</h5>
        <p>Without proper token management and architectural guardrails, a successful POC can quickly become a financial liability at scale. We implement cost constraints early, ensuring your unit economics make sense before you commit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 mb-4">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">The Research Rabbit Hole</h5>
        <p>It's easy to get lost in model tuning or chasing the latest benchmarks. We focus on "Production-First AI"—getting a reliable, monitorable system into the hands of users rather than perfecting a model in a vacuum.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 mb-4">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Infrastructure Debt</h5>
        <p>Building AI without a clear data strategy often leads to "spaghetti pipelines" that are impossible to maintain. We ensure your foundation is built for the long term, not just for a demo.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 mb-5">
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Data Pipelines & Quality Audit</h4>
        <p>We go beyond strategy fluff to technical reality. We evaluate your existing data pipelines, storage, quality controls, and governance to determine whether your infrastructure is fit for LLMs and other AI workloads.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 mb-5">
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Use-Case Prioritization</h4>
        <p>We help you pick the right first bet based on a framework of Impact, Feasibility, and Data Readiness. You get a ranked list of opportunities with clear reasoning—not a wish list.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 mb-5">
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Cost Modeling & Guardrails</h4>
        <p>We model the real costs and ROI across POC, 10x, and 100x scale. We look at tokens, embeddings, pipeline compute, and operational overhead to provide a reality check before you scale.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 mb-5">
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Build vs. Buy Analysis</h4>
        <p>Pragmatic advice on when to use managed AI services versus self-hosted models, and what to build in-house versus integrate from third parties. Every recommendation is grounded in your specific context.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 mb-5">
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Prioritized Roadmap</h4>
        <p>A phased implementation plan with clear milestones, dependencies, resource requirements, and decision points. Designed so your team can execute with confidence.</p>

        <p>This assessment is ideal for CEOs, CTOs, or Heads of Product at B2B SaaS or data-rich companies who want a clear "are we ready?" answer and a "what first?" roadmap.</p>
        <p>You should consider this if:</p>
        <ul class="ul-check primary list-unstyled">
          <li>You have AI on your product roadmap but haven't committed to a first use case</li>
          <li>You've stalled after a POC and need a path to production</li>
          <li>You want to validate AI feasibility before allocating significant engineering resources</li>
          <li>You need cost projections and ROI modeling to make the business case internally</li>
          <li>You're evaluating build vs. buy and want an unbiased technical opinion</li>
        </ul>
